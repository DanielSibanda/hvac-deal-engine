# HVAC-Deal-Engine

## What I Did and Why It Matters
SellSide wins where fragmented service markets meet repeatable growth levers.  
So I built a **50-company map** of HVAC / Mechanical / BAS controls firms across **PA/NJ/DE** with adjacency into **MD/DC/VA/NY**.

I biased toward:
- **Service-heavy revenue** (higher recurring cash flow)
- **BAS/controls capability** (stickier customers, better margins)
- **Dispatch density** (route efficiency → EBITDA lift)

This is **not just a list** — it's a **deal engine** for both sell-side and buy-side work.  
It mirrors private-market patterns where **service-heavy trades ~7–10× EBITDA** and project-heavy closer to **4–6×**, producing a ready micro-universe of add-on targets.

## Monte Carlo Highlights
- Entry Multiple: Tri(6.0, 7.0, 8.0×)  
- Exit Multiple: Tri(6.5, 7.5, 8.5×)  
- EBITDA margin: 12% + synergy uplift (~1.0% ± 0.5%)  
- Revenue CAGR: 4% ± 3%  
- 60% debt @ 9%, 40% equity, 5-year hold

**Results:**
- **Median IRR:** ~18–20%
- **P25/P75 IRR:** ~15–23%
- **Prob(IRR > 15%):** ~50–65%
- Entry EV: ~$40–45M • Exit EV: ~$55–70M

## Why These 50 Together?
**Service mix + Controls + Density** → recurring revenue, BAS stickiness, and route-density leverage.  
These are the levers that lift EV/EBITDA in private HVAC deals.
